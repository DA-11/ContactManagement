# ContactManagement
Welcome to the Contact Management Backend Application! This repository contains the backend code for a contact management system built using Express.js. It provides APIs for user registration, login, and various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing contacts. The application also ensures security by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and Bcrypt for password hashing. MongoDB is used as the database, and the Mongoose library is employed for handling interactions with MongoDB.

# Features
**User Registration**: API endpoint for user registration, allowing users to create accounts with a unique username and a securely hashed password.

**User Login**: API endpoint for user login, with authentication using JWT.

**Contact Management**: The application offers APIs to perform CRUD operations on contacts. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete their contacts.

**Security**: JSON Web Tokens are used to ensure secure authentication, and passwords are stored as hashed values using Bcrypt to enhance security.
